In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys.  If you attempt to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, PHP will not throw an error; instead, it will return `null`.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard-to-debug issues, especially in complex codebases. For example, consider the following:
```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
echo $myArray['c']; // Outputs nothing (null)
$result = $myArray['c'] * 10; // $result will be 0, not an error
```
This silent failure is problematic because it doesn't alert the programmer to the missing key. The code continues to execute, potentially with incorrect results.
